		<p> I designed this website to compile my findings on the Reddit and YouTube digital media platforms. This site contains 
			two data visualization projects that I did in Spring 2018.
			<br><br>
			Both Reddit and YouTube allowed me to explore why users might click on posts and videos that they find on the web.  </p>

		<h2> My Experiences Using Reddit </h2>
		<p id="left-text"> Reddit is a huge part of who I am. Everyday, I browse the different categories of subreddits. Then I got the idea 
			that I should investigate what prompts me to click on a Reddit post in the first place.
			<br><br>
			After recording a number of variables, I finally settled on using the relational chart type to represent my findings, because it  
			allowed me to draw connections about what similarities existed between both my finished and unfinished Reddit posts. I saw one 
			pattern in how some of my finished and unfinished Reddit posts only consisted of short-length posts. 
			<br><br>Another pattern that I picked up on was the same desire to either finish or abandon reading a Reddit post between those 
			already identified similar posts. 
			<br><br>
			By going back and looking at my data, I recognized a final pattern where the action and entertain themed finished posts had the 
			same ratings for their medium-length and long-length posts, because the words that I perceived be of most interest in the title 
			could have belonged in either the action or entertain themes; these two themes seemed to have some overlap that I did not foresee 
			beforehand. 
			<br><br>
			The marks and attributes that I used further demonstrate these relationships. 
			<br><br> 
			I chose to use curved arrow-shapes to demonstrate the similarities, because each side of the arrow points out that the 
			similarity applies to each object equally. I used triangles to represent finished Reddit posts, while using squares to represent 
			unfinished Reddit posts; these shapes were decided on because they are easy to distinguish from each other and add contrast to the chart. 
			<br><br> 
			I used the dashed lines to represent the different lengths of the Reddit posts; the dashed lines were designed to be straight, 
			diagonal lines to show off their stand-alone qualities so that they wouldnâ€™t be mistaken for the similarity arrows. 
			<br><br>
			I used circles to 
			represent each Reddit post, because the curved shape allows them to not be confused with the triangles and squares that I paired them 
			with; circles can also fit inside both the triangle and square shapes, so it also works to symbolize that the Reddit posts belong 
			within either the finished or unfinished Reddit post categories.

		<p> I spend a lot of my freetime on YouTube. But, I found myself wondering just how YouTube knows what videos to recommend to its users.
