		<p> I designed this website to compile my findings on the Reddit and YouTube digital media platforms. This site contains 
			two data visualization projects that I did in Spring 2018.
			<br><br>
			Both Reddit and YouTube allowed me to explore why users might click on the posts and videos that they find on the web.  </p>

		<h2> My Experiences Using Reddit </h2>
		<p id="left-text"> Reddit is a huge part of who I am. Everyday, I browse the different categories of subreddits. Then I got the idea 
			to investigate what prompts me to click on a Reddit post in the first place.
			<br><br>
			I set up a table where I recorded a number of variables, such as my rating of a post, whether I finished it or not, and what was 
			the theme did the post belong in. After recording my Reddit habits, I started looking at my collected data.
			<br><br>
			From studying the data, I began to notice patterns in how I chose the Reddit posts that I viewed. I observed that there were 
			similarities in both my finished and unfinished Reddit posts. I also noticed that I preferred to read shorter Reddit posts the most.
			It was also visible that I usually had the same desire to finish or abandon reading a Reddit post I had identified some existing 
			connection that they had to other similar posts.
			<br><br>
			When it came time to create a data visualization for my data, I chose the relational chart because it allowed me to the ease to 
			represent similarities and other connections. By recording my Reddit habits, I feel that I better understand why I enjoy spending 
			so much time on the site.

		<h2> The YouTube Algorithm </h2>

		<p> I spend a lot of my freetime on YouTube. But, I wondered how YouTube knew what videos to recommend to its users.
			<br><br>
			This is when I decided to do some research. YouTube basically uses at two algorithms, which are both called the YouTube Algorithm. By having the 
			flexibility of implementing two algorithms, YouTube is able to recommend content for its two very different audiences: registered users who have 
			YouTube accounts and unregistered users.
			<br><br>
			YouTube is able to use unregistered users' watch history to recommend their content. Whereas, YouTube is able to use registered YouTube users' 
			interactivity, such as liking and favoriting videos, to inform them of the content that they like to watch.
